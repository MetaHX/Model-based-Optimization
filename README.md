### Survey
- **`Open Issues`** [Open Issues in Surrogate-Assisted Optimization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-18764-4_10), J. Stork **`(2020)`** **`[Book:High-Performance Simulation-Based Optimization ]`**
This chapter discusses some open issues in surrogate-assisted optimizaiton.  The main open issues are:

1. Construct an adequate of Benchmark or test functions 

2. Constraint handling 

3. Surrogate ensemble

**`4.Combinatorial/discrete search space`**

5. Multiobjective optimization problems

6. Dynamic problems

7. Noisy problems

8. High dimensional problems
